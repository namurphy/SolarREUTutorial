# Solar REU Computing Tutorials: Days 1 & 2

Welcome to SSXG and the CfA! This is the repository for our first two computing tutorials, which will be on:

 - Tuesday, June 5 from 2–4 pm in Mission Ops
 - Wednesday, June 6 from 2–4 pm in Mission Ops

To get to Mission Ops, take the elevator behind the library all the way down to B, and go across the hall.

## Opening the tutorial via Google Colab

We will be using Google Colab, so you will need to be logged into your CfA account or another Google account.

To begin the tutorial, please go to the following link:

**https://colab.research.google.com/github/namurphy/SolarREUTutorial/blob/main/SolarREUPython.ipynb**

## Open the tutorial via Binder (backup)

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/namurphy/SolarREUTutorial/HEAD)
← use this link to automagically open a binder environment with all
the files in it and packages installed. It will take several minutes to
initialize. Note: Binder has had reduced liability lately because of 
reduced capacity.

A session may time out after inactivity, and it won't automatically save
notebooks (though you should be able to download them).

 - For the Unix part of the tutorial, go to the "Terminal"
 - For the Python part, go to "Python 3 (ipykernel)" under "Notebooks"
