# Solar REU Computing Tutorials: Days 1 & 2

Welcome to SSXG and the CfA!

 - Tuesday, June 5 from 2–4 pm in Ops
 - Wednesday, June 6 from 2–4 pm in Ops

To get to Ops, take the elevator behind the library all the way down to B,
and go across the hall.

## Instructions

There are a few options for getting set up for our tutorials.

### Open a Binder environment in your browser (quick, but less reliable)

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/namurphy/SolarREUTutorial/HEAD)
← use this link to automagically open a binder environment with all
the files in it and packages installed. It will take several minutes to
initialize. Note: Binder has had reduced liability lately because of 
reduced capacity.

A session may time out after inactivity, and it won't automatically save
notebooks (though you should be able to download them).

 - For the Unix part of the tutorial, go to the "Terminal"
 - For the Python part, go to "Python 3 (ipykernel)" under "Notebooks"

### Open a Google Colab environment (quick but no access to terminal)

(will add shortly)

Note: Google Colab does not provide free access to a terminal.

### Install Python and download files (requires installing software)

- [Install Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/navigator/install/)
- Download the contents of this repository by going to the green code
  button above and selecting "Download ZIP".
- Unzip the file in a convenient location like your Desktop or home directory.
