Welcome to SSXG and the CfA!

## Instructions

There are a few options for getting set up for our tutorials.

### Open a Binder environment in your browser (quick, but less reliable)

← use this link to automagically open a binder environment with all
the files in it and packages installed. It will take ≲ 5 minutes to
initialize. However, this site has been somewhat unreliable lately because of
limited capacity. Note that a session may time out due to inactivity.

### Open a Google Colab environment (quick but no access to terminal)

(will add shortly)

### Install Python and download files

(will add shortly)
