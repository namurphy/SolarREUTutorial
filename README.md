Welcome to SSXG and the CfA!

## Instructions

There are a few options for getting set up for our tutorials.

### Open a Binder environment in your browser (backup)

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/namurphy/SolarREUTutorial/HEAD)
← use this link to automagically open a binder environment with all
the files in it and packages installed. It will take several minutes to
initialize. Note: Binder has had reduced liability lately because of 
reduced capacity.

A session may time out after inactivity, and it won't automatically save
notebooks (though you should be able to download them).

 - For the Unix part of the tutorial, go to the "Terminal"
 - For the Python part, go to "Python 3 (ipykernel)" under "Notebooks"
